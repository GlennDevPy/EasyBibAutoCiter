# EasyBibAutoCiter
Automatically cites from easybib using api and requests - no need for ads 

3 Modes
[1] - Cite from text file
- do exporting and test
[2] - Cite one thing
- need to do exporting
[3] - Cite from manual mass link
- not yet started

Program will take links, and automatically cite them using easybib api. If its not 100% good (ie. fields missing), then will prompt user to fill those in. It is extremely messy and probably could use iteration but works for now. User can then edit if easybib did a bad job. 

Yet to do:
Export the citations. Project made but exporting not done for anything.
