### EasyBibAutoCiter

## Automatically cites from easybib using api and requests - no need for ads 

# 3 Modes

1. Cite from text file
- WORKING! Drag in text file and will auto cite
2. Cite one thing
- WORKING! Enter URL and Cite
3. Cite from manual mass link
- WORKING! Also ADD/REMOVE feature.

Program will take links, and automatically cite them using easybib api. If its not 100% good (ie. fields missing), then will prompt user to fill those in. It is extremely messy and probably could use iteration but works for now. User can then edit if easybib did a bad job. 

### Yet to do:



PRIORITY - ADD A WAY TO EXPORT FROM LINK AND GO STRAIGHT TO PROJECT PAGE**
